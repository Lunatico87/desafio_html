    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p> I am a 36-year-old Chilean man living in New Zealand with an open Work Visa and I am looking for my next role due to Christchurch relocation. Back in my country, I worked as a qualified occupational health and safety engineer in industries as construction, manufacturing, and industrial maintenance. 
        Working in New Zealand for the last four years, I gained experience in construction and factory processes. I worked as a light panel duct fabricator using different hand tools, press, and CNC router. Also, I worked as a press shop operator in an industrial kitchen factory where I cut, drilled, flow drilled and tap metal pieces using machinery. Additionally, I acquired experience in plumbing and construction processes working for a Tourism company building campervans. I installed water connections, pump and sink. I have experience manipulating electric and manual tools. We worked in a small team and because of that we learned different skills to accomplish our goals, which gave me the opportunity to work as part of a team.
        I am a hard-working responsible person and I am always keen to learn new skills.
